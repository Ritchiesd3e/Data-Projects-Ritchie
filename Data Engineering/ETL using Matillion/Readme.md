# Data Engineering Project: Matillion, Snowflake, and Databricks Integration

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Matillion** for ETL processes with **Snowflake** as the data warehouse. The project includes extracting data from Snowflake, creating a new view on top of sales data, and loading the final transformed data back into Snowflake. For data generation, Faker functions in **Databricks** were used to create random customer, order, and shop details.

## Components

- **Matillion**: ETL tool for data extraction, transformation, and loading.
- **Snowflake**: Data warehouse used for storing and processing data.
- **Databricks**: Platform for data generation and processing using Faker functions.
- **Faker Functions**: Used to generate random data for customers, orders, and shops.

## Project Details

### 1. Data Extraction
- **Tool**: Matillion
- **Source**: Snowflake
- **Description**: Extract data from Snowflake to begin the ETL process.

### 2. Data Transformation
- **Tool**: Matillion
- **Description**: Create a new view on top of the existing sales data to perform transformations and derive actionable insights.

### 3. Data Loading
- **Tool**: Matillion
- **Target**: Snowflake
- **Description**: Load the transformed data back into Snowflake, ensuring that the data is available for analysis and reporting.

### 4. Data Generation
- **Tool**: Databricks
- **Function**: Faker Functions
- **Description**: Generate random customer, order, and shop details to simulate real-world data scenarios and validate the ETL pipeline.
- **Code**: https://github.com/Ritchiesd3e/Data-Projects-Ritchie/blob/main/Data%20Engineering/ETL%20using%20Matillion%20/date%20generation.py

## Setup and Execution

### Prerequisites
- Snowflake account with access to data warehouses and databases.
- Matillion ETL instance connected to Snowflake.
- Databricks workspace for data generation using Faker functions.

### Steps

1. **Setup Matillion**
   - Configure Matillion to connect to your Snowflake instance.
   - Create ETL jobs for extracting, transforming, and loading data.

2. **Data Extraction**
   - Use Matillion’s Snowflake components to extract data from the source database.

3. **Data Transformation**
   - Design a transformation job in Matillion to create a new view based on the sales data.

4. **Data Loading**
   - Load the transformed data back into Snowflake using Matillion’s loading components.

5. **Data Generation**
   - In Databricks, use Faker functions to generate random data.
   - Insert this data into Snowflake to test the ETL pipeline.

6. **Validation**
   - Verify the accuracy of the data transformations and ensure the final dataset is correct.

## Learnings

- Gained hands-on experience with Matillion for ETL processes.
- Enhanced skills in data transformation and loading using Matillion.
- Applied Faker functions in Databricks for realistic data generation.
